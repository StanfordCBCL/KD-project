create a function like 
extract_label_ids 

where basically we have to talk all the points again and then basically figure out the order in which they should actually appear 
--maybe we need to rewrite bibgboy? 

basically the current arrays are all indexed with the pointID? 
and that's how it appears in prelim analysis too? 
but i'm unsure how we can get the right point's information, but then when we try to attach the arrays the shit breaks. that's really interesting. 

i wonder if setting teh point is now breaking something -- i'm gonna have to see if attaching the arrays before that all happens will make a difference

To run the FSI code for dye retention time 
- all results
- mesh:
	 rca_m5_asi2

THINGS TO CHANGE IN MANUSCRIPT 

REFERENCE CHANGES
add some more references:
- the kim et al paper that includes coronary BC 
- papers w/ other methods, closed-looop LPN, 

WRITING CHANGES: 
- figure out figure organization
- include more motivation about which aneurysm shape parameters were chosen 
- developing a framework that allows significant testing, optimizes utilization of patient data 
- this framework allows for experimentation with material property effects as well 
- talk about FSI in the paper (both why we haven't done it yet, and also that it's a nice future step)
- using rigid simulations bc anatomical changes are central to hemodynamics, and potentially localized changes matter less


methodology changes: 
- figure out secondary flows/how to quantify jet fluctuation

literally fml lol i need to re run simulations 

1) upload meshes and stuff again 
2) prepare svpre file again 
3) run preprocessing
4) test out gcode 
5) run simulation 
6) compress restart files -> restart, geombc
7) run FSI simulation
8) look at FSI simulation results





------
so i need to 
- cite justins paper about using FSI 
- cite the paper about RT vs dye advection vs particle tracing 
- interpret the dye advection results 
- add secondary flow results, make that figure
