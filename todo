create a function like 
extract_label_ids 

where basically we have to talk all the points again and then basically figure out the order in which they should actually appear 
--maybe we need to rewrite bibgboy? 

basically the current arrays are all indexed with the pointID? 
and that's how it appears in prelim analysis too? 
but i'm unsure how we can get the right point's information, but then when we try to attach the arrays the shit breaks. that's really interesting. 

i wonder if setting teh point is now breaking something -- i'm gonna have to see if attaching the arrays before that all happens will make a difference



-----

to run the FSI code 
- all results
- mesh 
	 need 


	 rca_m5_asi2
	 	all_results.vtu
		mesh-complete.mesh.vtu
		inflow.vtp

config script probably doesn't need to be changed

will probably be pretty speedy


add some more references 
- the kim et al paper that includes coronary BC 
- papers w/ other methods, closed-looop LPN, 
- include more motivation about which aneurysm shape parameters were chosen 
- figure out secondary flows/how to quantify jet fluctuation 
- figure out figure organization
- talk about FSI in the paper (both why we haven't done it yet, and also that it's a nice future step)
- develpping a framework that allows significant testing but optimizes utilization of patient data 
- using rigid simulations bc anatomical changes are central to hemodynamics, and potentially localized changes matter less
- this framework allows for experimentation with material property effects as well
