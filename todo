create a function like 
extract_label_ids 

where basically we have to talk all the points again and then basically figure out the order in which they should actually appear 
--maybe we need to rewrite bibgboy? 

basically the current arrays are all indexed with the pointID? 
and that's how it appears in prelim analysis too? 
but i'm unsure how we can get the right point's information, but then when we try to attach the arrays the shit breaks. that's really interesting. 

i wonder if setting teh point is now breaking something -- i'm gonna have to see if attaching the arrays before that all happens will make a difference
